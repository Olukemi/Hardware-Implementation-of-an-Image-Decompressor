# Hardware-Implementation-of-an-Image-Decompressor
Individually designed and built an embedded spatial measurement system that gathers data from any given space using a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor and a stepper motor to display a 3D image of the space
Provides a 360-degree measurement of distance within a single vertical geometric plane
The data is then analyzed using a PC application, Python and graphically mapped and displayed
